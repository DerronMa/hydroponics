		 <h2>Nutrient Flim Technique</h2>
		 <p>
			 This method is growing plants in a stream of continuously running
			 water. The plants can be placed in a shallow container and
			 the water containing the nutrients runs through the roots.

		 <p>
			 The system usually runs by gravity: the rectangular container
			 is placed in a slant position so that the water
			 trickles downwards until it has passed though the roots of
			 the plants and into a lower storage container where it is
			 pumped back up to the higher part of the container.
</p>
			 <p>	The advantage of this method is that it uses the nutrients efficiently, it allows
				oxygen to reach the roots (important for healthy growth) and
				 the nutrient solution can be adjusted very easily. The main disadvantage
				 is that if there are problems occured regarding to the circular system and the solution
				 does not flow smoothly(e.g. sulution stays in a pod), it takes time until the whole system is fixed(bad for the plants
				 which are having a lot of or not enough water).
